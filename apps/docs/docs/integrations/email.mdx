# Email

If you want to receive an email notification each time a user completes the bot or if you want to send a recap to the user, the Email block is made for you:

<img src="/img/integrations/email.png" width="400" alt="Email block example" />

By default the email will be send from notifications@typebot.io. But you can choose to use your own email (SMTP) account, using the "From:" dropdown and filling in your credentials.

I've recorded a tutorial on how to connect your Gmail account ([even though this isn't recommended](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/)):

## Body configuration

You can customize the email you want to send:

<img
  src="/img/integrations/email-body.png"
  width="400"
  alt="Email block example"
/>

The email will be sent each time the block is triggered. You can, of course, have multiple Email block in a the same flow.
